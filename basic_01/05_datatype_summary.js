//javascript is a dynamic language.
//Here are some reasons why:

//1)Dynamic Typing: Variables in JavaScript can hold values of any data type, and the type can change at runtime.
//   For example, you can assign a number to a variable and later assign a string to the same variable without any type errors.


//2)Runtime Object Construction: You can add or remove properties 
//  from objects at runtime. This means the structure of objects is not fixed and can be modified dynamically.

//non-premitive---//(oR reference type)
